# Themes

- A theme controls the front end or customer facing view of IER.

- The technology that exposes the various APIs that IER uses is called Knockout JS. You can read more about it [here](http://knockoutjs.com/).

- The templating language that is used is called Liquid. You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers).

- The front end framework used for the layout and design is Bootstrap. You can read more about it [here](http://getbootstrap.com/).

- As a designer, any front end framework can be used such as Bootstrap, HTML Boilerplate, Ivory, Gumby, Zurb Foundation, Skeleton...the list goes on.

- It is up to _you_ as the designer to ensure that the APIs that IER uses are exposed and all the directory dependencies remain intact.

- That being said, themes are extremely versatile from a design standpoint. As long as the KnockoutJS has been added to your views, you can turn IER into anything from a simple, single-page app to a multi-page, ecommerce driven website.
