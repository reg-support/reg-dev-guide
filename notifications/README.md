# Notifications

- Notifications are the least intuitive and fun part of IER. HTML email in general can be a bit of a nightmare, and IER notifications are no exception to that rule.

- The default notifications are built with the standard Zurb Foundation CSS template for HTML emails.  **EDIT AT THE RISK OF YOUR SANITY!**

- The first thing you should do is read about the file structure of the notifications **[here](file_structure/README.md)**
