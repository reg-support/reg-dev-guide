## <a name="1">Style Guide

##### About This Guide

- This guide will outline the basic style rules in use throughout this guide. Sticking to a single set of guidelines will help us keep the guide maintainable and clean.
- At the end of the day, these are just guidelines--try to adhere to them as often as possible, but don't fret if it makes sense to break them from time to time. Use your best judgement!
- When in doubt, check the unrendered Markdown source for any of these pages.

##### Headers

- Headers should be created with leading `#` syntax, rather than underlines.
- Headers of all sizes should have one blank line both above and below them.
- Page title should be on the first line of the page as an h1 element, by using `#`
- "Major" headers, to denote sections, should be h2 elements, by using `##`
- "Minor" headers, to denote sub-sections, should be h5 elements, by using `#####`

##### Table of Contents

- Create TOC for folders with multiple pages
- Create a table of contents for pages with many sections, and link to the major sections (i.e. the `##` elements)
- Show simple example of TOC for a single page
- Always include a 'back to top' link

##### Code

- Code blocks always fully left-aligned
